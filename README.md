# Sentence Transformers: Embeddings, Retrieval, and Reranking

This framework provides an easy method to compute embeddings for accessing, using, and training state-of-the-art embedding and reranker models. It can be used to compute embeddings using Sentence Transformer models ([quickstart](https://sbert.net/docs/quickstart.html#sentence-transformer)), to calculate similarity scores using Cross-Encoder (a.k.a. reranker) models ([quickstart](https://sbert.net/docs/quickstart.html#cross-encoder)) or to generate sparse embeddings using Sparse Encoder models ([quickstart](https://sbert.net/docs/quickstart.html#sparse-encoder)). This unlocks a wide range of applications, including [semantic search](https://sbert.net/examples/applications/semantic-search/README.html), [semantic textual similarity](https://sbert.net/docs/sentence_transformer/usage/semantic_textual_similarity.html), and [paraphrase mining](https://sbert.net/examples/applications/paraphrase-mining/README.html).

A wide selection of over [15,000 pre-trained Sentence Transformers models](https://huggingface.co/models?library=sentence-transformers) are available for immediate use on 🤗 Hugging Face, including many of the state-of-the-art models from the [Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB) leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard). Additionally, it is easy to train or finetune your own [embedding models](https://sbert.net/docs/sentence_transformer/training_overview.html), [reranker models](https://sbert.net/docs/cross_encoder/training_overview.html) or [sparse encoder models](https://sbert.net/docs/sparse_encoder/training_overview.html) using Sentence Transformers, enabling you to create custom models for your specific use cases.

For the **full documentation**, see **[www.SBERT.net](https://www.sbert.net)**.

## Installation

We recommend **Python 3.9+**, **[PyTorch 1.11.0+](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)**, and **[transformers v4.34.0+](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)**.

**Install with pip**

```
pip install -U sentence-transformers
```

**Install with conda**

```
conda install -c conda-forge sentence-transformers
```

**Install from sources**

Alternatively, you can also clone the latest version from the [repository](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers) and install it directly from the source code:

````
pip install -e .
```` 

**PyTorch with CUDA**

If you want to use a GPU / CUDA, you must install PyTorch with the matching CUDA Version. Follow
[PyTorch - Get Started](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for further details how to install PyTorch.

## Getting Started

See [Quickstart](https://www.sbert.net/docs/quickstart.html) in our documentation.

### Embedding Models

First download a pretrained embedding a.k.a. Sentence Transformer model.

````python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
````

Then provide some texts to the model.

````python
sentences = [
    "The weather is lovely today.",
    "It's so sunny outside!",
    "He drove to the stadium.",
]
embeddings = model.encode(sentences)
print(embeddings.shape)
# => (3, 384)
````

And that's already it. We now have a numpy arrays with the embeddings, one for each text. We can use these to compute similarities.

````python
similarities = model.similarity(embeddings, embeddings)
print(similarities)
# tensor([[1.0000, 0.6660, 0.1046],
#         [0.6660, 1.0000, 0.1411],
#         [0.1046, 0.1411, 1.0000]])
````

### Reranker Models

First download a pretrained reranker a.k.a. Cross Encoder model.

```python
from sentence_transformers import CrossEncoder

# 1. Load a pretrained CrossEncoder model
model = CrossEncoder("cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L6-v2")
```

Then provide some texts to the model.

```python
# The texts for which to predict similarity scores
query = "How many people live in Berlin?"
passages = [
    "Berlin had a population of 3,520,031 registered inhabitants in an area of 891.82 square kilometers.",
    "Berlin has a yearly total of about 135 million day visitors, making it one of the most-visited cities in the European Union.",
    "In 2013 around 600,000 Berliners were registered in one of the more than 2,300 sport and fitness clubs.",
]

# 2a. predict scores pairs of texts
scores = model.predict([(query, passage) for passage in passages])
print(scores)
# => [8.607139 5.506266 6.352977]
```

And we're good to go. You can also use [`model.rank`](https://sbert.net/docs/package_reference/cross_encoder/cross_encoder.html#sentence_transformers.cross_encoder.CrossEncoder.rank) to avoid having to perform the reranking manually:

```python
# 2b. Rank a list of passages for a query
ranks = model.rank(query, passages, return_documents=True)

print("Query:", query)
for rank in ranks:
    print(f"- #{rank['corpus_id']} ({rank['score']:.2f}): {rank['text']}")
"""
Query: How many people live in Berlin?
- #0 (8.61): Berlin had a population of 3,520,031 registered inhabitants in an area of 891.82 square kilometers.
- #2 (6.35): In 2013 around 600,000 Berliners were registered in one of the more than 2,300 sport and fitness clubs.
- #1 (5.51): Berlin has a yearly total of about 135 million day visitors, making it one of the most-visited cities in the European Union.
"""
```
### Sparse Encoder Models

First download a pretrained sparse embedding a.k.a. Sparse Encoder model.

```python

from sentence_transformers import SparseEncoder

# 1. Load a pretrained SparseEncoder model
model = SparseEncoder("naver/splade-cocondenser-ensembledistil")

# The sentences to encode
sentences = [
    "The weather is lovely today.",
    "It's so sunny outside!",
    "He drove to the stadium.",
]

# 2. Calculate sparse embeddings by calling model.encode()
embeddings = model.encode(sentences)
print(embeddings.shape)
# [3, 30522] - sparse representation with vocabulary size dimensions

# 3. Calculate the embedding similarities
similarities = model.similarity(embeddings, embeddings)
print(similarities)
# tensor([[   35.629,     9.154,     0.098],
#         [    9.154,    27.478,     0.019],
#         [    0.098,     0.019,    29.553]])

# 4. Check sparsity stats
stats = SparseEncoder.sparsity(embeddings)
print(f"Sparsity: {stats['sparsity_ratio']:.2%}")
# Sparsity: 99.84%
```

## Pre-Trained Models

We provide a large list of pretrained models for more than 100 languages. Some models are general purpose models, while others produce embeddings for specific use cases.
