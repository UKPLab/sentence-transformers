"""
This file contains an example how to make a SentenceTransformer model faster and lighter.

This is achieved by using Knowledge Distillation: We use a well working teacher model to train
a fast and light student model. The student model learns to imitate the produced
sentence embeddings from the teacher. We train this on a diverse set of sentences we got
from SNLI + Multi+NLI + Wikipedia.

After the distillation is finished, the student model produce nearly the same embeddings as the
teacher, however, it will be much faster.

The script implements to options two options to initialize the student:
Option 1: Train a light transformer model like TinyBERT to imitate the teacher
Option 2: We take the teacher model and keep only certain layers, for example, only 4 layers.

Option 2) works usually better, as we keep most of the weights from the teacher. In Option 1, we have to tune all
weights in the student from scratch.

There is a performance - speed trade-off. However, we found that a student with 4 instead of 12 layers keeps about 99.4%
of the teacher performance, while being 2.3 times faster.
