# Applications

SparseEncoder can be used for various use-cases. In these folders, you find several example scripts that show case how SparseEncoder can be used

## Computing Embeddings

The [computing_embeddings](computing_embeddings/) folder contains examples how to compute sentence embeddings using SparseEncoder.

## Semantic Textual Similarity

The [semantic_textual_similarity](semantic_textual_similarity/) folder contains examples how to compute semantic textual similarity between sentences using SparseEncoder.

## Semantic Search

The [semantic_search](semantic_search/) folder shows examples for semantic search: Given a sentence, find in a large collection semantically similar sentences.

## Retrieve & Rerank

The [retrieve_rerank](retrieve_rerank/) folder shows how to combine a bi-encoder for semantic search retrieval and a more powerful re-ranking stage with a cross-encoder.
