"""
This is a more complex example on performing clustering on large scale dataset.

This examples find in a large set of sentences local communities, i.e., groups of sentences that are highly
similar. You can freely configure the threshold what is considered as similar. A high threshold will
only find extremely similar sentences, a lower threshold will find more sentence that are less similar.

A second parameter is 'min_community_size': Only communities with at least a certain number of sentences will be returned.

The method for finding the communities is extremely fast, for clustering 50k sentences it requires only 5 seconds (plus embedding comuptation).

In this example, we download a large set of questions from Quora and then find similar questions in this set.
