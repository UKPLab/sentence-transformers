    "You can input a query or a question. The script then uses semantic search\n",
    "to find relevant passages in Simple English Wikipedia (as it is smaller and fits better in RAM).\n",

    "For semantic search, we use `SentenceTransformer('multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1')` and retrieve\n",
    "32 potentially passages that answer the input query.\n",

    "Next, we use a more powerful CrossEncoder (`cross_encoder = CrossEncoder('cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2')`) that\n",
    "scores the query and all retrieved passages for their relevancy. The cross-encoder further boost the performance,\n",

They believe that dumplings can hold the god of Wealth and bring luck. The last day of the Chinese New Year is the Lantern Festival. On this day, the moon becomes the full moon.
