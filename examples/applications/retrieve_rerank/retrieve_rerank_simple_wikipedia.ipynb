    "# Retrieve & Re-Rank Demo over Simple Wikipedia\n",
    "\n",
    "This examples demonstrates the Retrieve & Re-Rank Setup and allows to search over [Simple Wikipedia](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can input a query or a question. The script then uses semantic search\n",
    "to find relevant passages in Simple English Wikipedia (as it is smaller and fits better in RAM).\n",
    "\n",
    "For semantic search, we use `SentenceTransformer('multi-qa-MiniLM-L6-cos-v1')` and retrieve\n",
    "32 potentially passages that answer the input query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we use a more powerful CrossEncoder (`cross_encoder = CrossEncoder('cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2')`) that\n",
    "scores the query and all retrieved passages for their relevancy. The cross-encoder further boost the performance,\n",
    "especially when you search over a corpus for which the bi-encoder was not trained for.\n"
