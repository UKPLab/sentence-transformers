    # This is a helper function to showcase how usearch can be used with quantized embeddings.
    # You must either provide the `corpus_embeddings` or the `corpus_index` usearch index, but not both.
    # In the first call we'll provide the `corpus_embeddings` and get the `corpus_index` back, which
    # we'll use in the next call. In practice, the index is stored in RAM or saved to disk, and not
    # recalculated for every query.

    # This function will 1) quantize the query embeddings to the same precision as the corpus embeddings,
    # 2) perform the semantic search using usearch, 3) rescore the results using the full precision embeddings,
    # and 4) return the results and the search time (and perhaps the usearch index).

    # `corpus_precision` must be the same as the precision used to quantize the corpus embeddings.
    # It is used to convert the query embeddings to the same precision as the corpus embeddings.
    # `top_k` determines how many results are returned for each query.
    # `rescore_multiplier` is a parameter for the rescoring step. Rather than searching for the top_k results,
    # we search for top_k * rescore_multiplier results and rescore the top_k results using the full precision embeddings.
    # So, higher values of rescore_multiplier will give better results, but will be slower.

    # `calibration_embeddings` is a set of embeddings used to calibrate the quantization of the query embeddings.
    # This is important only if you are using uint8 or int8 precision. In practice, this is used to calculate
    # the minimum and maximum values of each of the embedding dimensions, which are then used to determine the
    # quantization thresholds.

    # `rescore` determines whether to rescore the results using the full precision embeddings, if False & the
    # corpus is quantized, the results will be very poor. `exact` determines whether to use the exact search
    # or the approximate search method in usearch.
