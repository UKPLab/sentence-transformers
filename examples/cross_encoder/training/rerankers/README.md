# Rerankers

```{eval-rst}
Reranker models are often :class:`~sentence_transformers.cross_encoder.CrossEncoder` models with 1 output class, i.e. given a pair of texts (query, answer), the model outputs one score. This score, either a float score that reasonably ranges between -10.0 and 10.0, or a score that's bound to 0...1, denotes to what extent the answer can help answer the query.

Many reranker models are trained on MS MARCO:

- `MS MARCO Pre-trained Cross Encoders <../../../../docs/cross_encoder/pretrained_models.html#ms-marco>`_
- `Cross Encoder > Training Examples > MS MARCO <../ms_marco/README.html>`_
```

But most likely, you will get the best results when training on your dataset. Because of this, this page includes some examples training scripts that you can adopt for your own data:

* **[training_gooaq_bce.py](training_gooaq_bce.py)**:
    ```{eval-rst}
    This example uses :class:`~sentence_transformers.cross_encoder.losses.BinaryCrossEntropyLoss` on labeled pair data that was mined from the `GooAQ <https://huggingface.co/datasets/sentence-transformers/gooaq>`_ dataset using an efficient :class:`~sentence_transformer.SentenceTransformers`.

    The model is evaluated on subsets of `MS MARCO <https://huggingface.co/datasets/sentence-transformers/NanoMSMARCO-bm25>`_, `NFCorpus <https://huggingface.co/datasets/sentence-transformers/NanoNFCorpus-bm25>`_, `NQ <https://huggingface.co/datasets/sentence-transformers/NanoNQ-bm25>`_ via the :class:`~sentence_transformers.cross_encoder.evaluation.CrossEncoderNanoBEIREvaluator`. Additionally, it is evaluated on the performance gain when reranking the top 100 results from an efficient :class:`~sentence_transformer.SentenceTransformers` on the GooAQ development set.
    ```
* **[training_gooaq_cmnrl.py](training_gooaq_cmnrl.py)**:
    ```{eval-rst}
    This example uses :class:`~sentence_transformers.cross_encoder.losses.CachedMultipleNegativesRankingLoss` on positive pair data loaded from the `GooAQ <https://huggingface.co/datasets/sentence-transformers/gooaq>`_ dataset.

    The model is evaluated on subsets of `MS MARCO <https://huggingface.co/datasets/sentence-transformers/NanoMSMARCO-bm25>`_, `NFCorpus <https://huggingface.co/datasets/sentence-transformers/NanoNFCorpus-bm25>`_, `NQ <https://huggingface.co/datasets/sentence-transformers/NanoNQ-bm25>`_ via the :class:`~sentence_transformers.cross_encoder.evaluation.CrossEncoderNanoBEIREvaluator`.
    ```
* **[training_gooaq_lambda.py](training_gooaq_lambda.py)**:
    ```{eval-rst}
    This example uses :class:`~sentence_transformers.cross_encoder.losses.LambdaLoss` on labeled list data that was mined from the `GooAQ <https://huggingface.co/datasets/sentence-transformers/gooaq>`_ dataset using an efficient :class:`~sentence_transformer.SentenceTransformers`.

    The model is evaluated on subsets of `MS MARCO <https://huggingface.co/datasets/sentence-transformers/NanoMSMARCO-bm25>`_, `NFCorpus <https://huggingface.co/datasets/sentence-transformers/NanoNFCorpus-bm25>`_, `NQ <https://huggingface.co/datasets/sentence-transformers/NanoNQ-bm25>`_ via the :class:`~sentence_transformers.cross_encoder.evaluation.CrossEncoderNanoBEIREvaluator`. Additionally, it is evaluated on the performance gain when reranking the top 100 results from an efficient :class:`~sentence_transformer.SentenceTransformers` on the GooAQ development set.
    ```
* **[training_nq_bce.py](training_nq_bce.py)**:
    ```{eval-rst}
    This example uses a near-identical training script as ``training_gooaq_bce.py``, except on the smaller `NQ (natural questions) <https://huggingface.co/datasets/sentence-transformers/natural-questions>`_ dataset.
    ```

## BinaryCrossEntropyLoss

```{eval-rst}
The :class:`~sentence_transformers.cross_encoder.losses.BinaryCrossEntropyLoss` is a very strong yet simple loss. Given pairs of texts (e.g. (query, answer) pairs), this loss uses the :class:`~sentence_transformers.cross_encoder.CrossEncoder` model to compute prediction scores. It compares these against the gold (or silver, a.k.a. determined with some model) labels, and computes a lower loss the better the model is doing.
```

## CachedMultipleNegativesRankingLoss

```{eval-rst}
The :class:`~sentence_transformers.cross_encoder.losses.CachedMultipleNegativesRankingLoss` (a.k.a. InfoNCE with GradCache) is more complex than the common :class:`~sentence_transformers.cross_encoder.losses.BinaryCrossEntropyLoss`. It accepts positive pairs (i.e. (query, answer) pairs) or triplets (i.e. (query, right_answer, wrong_answer) triplets), and will then randomly find ``num_negatives`` extra incorrect answers per query by taking answers from other questions in the batch. This is often referred to as "in-batch negatives".

The loss will then compute scores for all (query, answer) pairs, *including* the incorrect answers ones it just selected. The loss will then use a Cross Entropy Loss to ensure that the score of the (query, correct_answer) is higher than (query, wrong_answer) for all (randomly selected) wrong answers.

The :class:`~sentence_transformers.cross_encoder.losses.CachedMultipleNegativesRankingLoss` uses an approach called `GradCache <https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06983>`_ to allow computing the scores in mini-batches without increasing the memory usage excessively. This loss is recommended over the "standard" :class:`~sentence_transformers.cross_encoder.losses.MultipleNegativesRankingLoss` (a.k.a. InfoNCE) loss, which does not have this clever mini-batching support and thus requires a lot of memory.

Experimentation with an ``activation_fn`` and ``scale`` is warranted for this loss. :class:`torch.nn.Sigmoid` with ``scale=10.0`` works okay, :class:`torch.nn.Identity`` with ``scale=1.0`` also works, and the `mGTE <https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19669>`_ paper authors suggest using :class:`torch.nn.Tanh` with ``scale=10.0``.

## Inference

The [tomaarsen/reranker-ModernBERT-base-gooaq-bce](https://huggingface.co/tomaarsen/reranker-ModernBERT-base-gooaq-bce) model was trained with the first script. If you want to try out the model before training something yourself, feel free to use this script:

```python
from sentence_transformers import CrossEncoder
