        The MatryoshkaLoss can be seen as a loss *modifier* that allows you to use other loss functions at various
        different embedding dimensions. This is useful for when you want to train a model where users have the option
        to lower the embedding dimension to improve their embedding comparison speed and costs.

        This loss is also compatible with the Cached... losses, which are in-batch negative losses that allow for
        higher batch sizes. The higher batch sizes allow for more negatives, and often result in a stronger model.

        Args:
            model: SentenceTransformer model
            loss: The loss function to be used, e.g.
                :class:`MultipleNegativesRankingLoss`,
                :class:`CoSENTLoss`, etc.
            matryoshka_dims: A list of embedding dimensions to be used
                for the loss function, e.g. [768, 512, 256, 128, 64].
            matryoshka_weights: A list of weights to be used for the
                loss function, e.g. [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. If None, then the
                weights will be set to 1 for all dimensions.
            n_dims_per_step: The number of dimensions to use per step.
                If -1, then all dimensions are used. If > 0, then a
                random sample of n_dims_per_step dimensions are used per
                step. The default value is -1.
