class MarginMSELoss(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, model: SentenceTransformer, similarity_fct=util.pairwise_dot_score) -> None:
        """
        Compute the MSE loss between the ``|sim(Query, Pos) - sim(Query, Neg)|`` and ``|gold_sim(Query, Pos) - gold_sim(Query, Neg)|``.
        By default, sim() is the dot-product. The gold_sim is often the similarity score from a teacher model.

        In contrast to :class:`~sentence_transformers.losses.MultipleNegativesRankingLoss`, the two passages do not
        have to be strictly positive and negative, both can be relevant or not relevant for a given query. This can be
        an advantage of MarginMSELoss over MultipleNegativesRankingLoss, but note that the MarginMSELoss is much slower
        to train. With MultipleNegativesRankingLoss, with a batch size of 64, we compare one query against 128 passages.
        With MarginMSELoss, we compare a query only against two passages. It's also possible to use multiple negatives
        with MarginMSELoss, but the training would be even slower to train.

        Args:
            model: SentenceTransformerModel
            similarity_fct: Which similarity function to use.

        Requirements:
            1. (query, passage_one, passage_two) triplets or (query, positive, negative_1, ..., negative_n)
            2. Usually used with a finetuned teacher M in a knowledge distillation setup

        Relations:
            - :class:`MSELoss` is similar to this loss, but without a margin through the negative pair.

        Example:

            With gold labels, e.g. if you have hard scores for sentences. Imagine you want a model to embed sentences
            with similar "quality" close to each other. If the "text1" has quality 5 out of 5, "text2" has quality
            1 out of 5, and "text3" has quality 3 out of 5, then the similarity of a pair can be defined as the
            difference of the quality scores. So, the similarity between "text1" and "text2" is 4, and the
            similarity between "text1" and "text3" is 2. If we use this as our "Teacher Model", the label becomes
            similraity("text1", "text2") - similarity("text1", "text3") = 4 - 2 = 2.

            Positive values denote that the first passage is more similar to the query than the second passage,
            while negative values denote the opposite.

                trainer.train()

            We can also use a teacher model to compute the similarity scores. In this case, we can use the teacher model
            to compute the similarity scores and use them as the silver labels. This is often used in knowledge distillation.
