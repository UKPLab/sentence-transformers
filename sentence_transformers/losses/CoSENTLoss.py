        """
        This class implements CoSENT (Cosine Sentence) loss.
        It expects that each of the InputExamples consists of a pair of texts and a float valued label, representing
        the expected similarity score between the pair.

        It computes the following loss function:

        ``loss = logsum(1+exp(s(i,j)-s(k,l))+exp...)``, where ``(i,j)`` and ``(k,l)`` are any of the input pairs in the
        batch such that the expected similarity of ``(i,j)`` is greater than ``(k,l)``. The summation is over all possible
        pairs of input pairs in the batch that match this condition.

        Anecdotal experiments show that this loss function produces a more powerful training signal than :class:`CosineSimilarityLoss`,
        resulting in faster convergence and a final model with superior performance. Consequently, CoSENTLoss may be used
        as a drop-in replacement for :class:`CosineSimilarityLoss` in any training script.

        Args:
            model: SentenceTransformerModel
            similarity_fct: Function to compute the PAIRWISE similarity
                between embeddings. Default is
                ``util.pairwise_cos_sim``.
            scale: Output of similarity function is multiplied by scale
                value. Represents the inverse temperature.

            - For further details, see: https://kexue.fm/archives/8847

        Requirements:
            - Sentence pairs with corresponding similarity scores in range of the similarity function. Default is [-1,1].

        Inputs:
            +--------------------------------+------------------------+
            | Texts                          | Labels                 |
            +================================+========================+
            | (sentence_A, sentence_B) pairs | float similarity score |
            +--------------------------------+------------------------+

        Relations:
            - :class:`AnglELoss` is CoSENTLoss with ``pairwise_angle_sim`` as the metric, rather than ``pairwise_cos_sim``.
            - :class:`CosineSimilarityLoss` seems to produce a weaker training signal than CoSENTLoss. In our experiments, CoSENTLoss is recommended.
