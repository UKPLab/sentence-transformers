        This loss expects as input a batch consisting of sentence pairs ``(a_1, p_1), (a_2, p_2)..., (a_n, p_n)``
        where we assume that ``(a_i, p_i)`` are a positive pair and ``(a_i, p_j)`` for ``i != j`` a negative pair.

        For each ``a_i``, it uses all other ``p_j`` as negative samples, i.e., for ``a_i``, we have 1 positive example
        (``p_i``) and ``n-1`` negative examples (``p_j``). It then minimizes the negative log-likehood for softmax
        normalized scores.

        This loss function works great to train embeddings for retrieval setups where you have positive pairs
        (e.g. (query, relevant_doc)) as it will sample in each batch ``n-1`` negative docs randomly.

        The performance usually increases with increasing batch sizes.

        You can also provide one or multiple hard negatives per anchor-positive pair by structering the data like this:
        ``(a_1, p_1, n_1), (a_2, p_2, n_2)``. Then, ``n_1`` is a hard negative for ``(a_1, p_1)``. The loss will use for
        the pair ``(a_i, p_i)`` all ``p_j`` for ``j != i`` and all ``n_j`` as negatives.

        :param model: SentenceTransformer model
        :param scale: Output of similarity function is multiplied by scale value
        :param similarity_fct: similarity function between sentence embeddings. By default, cos_sim. Can also be set to dot product (and then set scale to 1)

        Requirements:
            1. (anchor, positive) pairs or (anchor, positive, negative) triplets

        Relations:
            - :class:`CachedMultipleNegativesRankingLoss` is equivalent to this loss, but it uses caching that allows for
            much higher batch sizes (and thus better performance) without extra memory usage. However, it requires more
            training time.
            - :class:`MultipleNegativesSymmetricRankingLoss` is equivalent to this loss, but with an additional loss term.
