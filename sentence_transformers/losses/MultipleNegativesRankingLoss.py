    """
        This loss expects as input a batch consisting of sentence pairs (a_1, p_1), (a_2, p_2)..., (a_n, p_n)
        where we assume that (a_i, p_i) are a positive pair and (a_i, p_j) for i!=j a negative pair.

        For each a_i, it uses all other p_j as negative samples, i.e., for a_i, we have 1 positive example (p_i) and
        n-1 negative examples (p_j). It then minimizes the negative log-likehood for softmax normalized scores.

        This loss function works great to train embeddings for retrieval setups where you have positive pairs (e.g. (query, relevant_doc))
        as it will sample in each batch n-1 negative docs randomly.

        The performance usually increases with increasing batch sizes.

        For more information, see: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.00652.pdf
        (Efficient Natural Language Response Suggestion for Smart Reply, Section 4.4)

        You can also provide one or multiple hard negatives per anchor-positive pair by structering the data like this:
        (a_1, p_1, n_1), (a_2, p_2, n_2)

        Here, n_1 is a hard negative for (a_1, p_1). The loss will use for the pair (a_i, p_i) all p_j (j!=i) and all n_j as negatives.

            from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, losses, InputExample
            from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

            model = SentenceTransformer('distilbert-base-uncased')
            train_examples = [InputExample(texts=['Anchor 1', 'Positive 1']),
                InputExample(texts=['Anchor 2', 'Positive 2'])]
            train_dataloader = DataLoader(train_examples, shuffle=True, batch_size=32)
