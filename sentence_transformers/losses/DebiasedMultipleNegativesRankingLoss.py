        This loss is a debiased version of the `MultipleNegativesRankingLoss` loss that addresses the inherent sampling bias in the negative examples.

        In standard contrastive loss, negative samples are drawn randomly from the dataset, leading to potential false negatives.

        This debiased loss adjusts for this sampling bias by reweighting the contributions of positive and negative terms in the denominator.

        For each ``a_i``, it uses all other ``p_j`` as negative samples, i.e., for ``a_i``, we have 1 positive example
        (``p_i``) and ``n-1`` negative examples (``p_j``). Unlike the standard implementation, this loss applies a correction
        term to account for the sampling bias introduced by in-batch negatives. Specifically, it adjusts the influence of
        negatives based on a prior probability ``tau_plus``.

        It then minimizes the negative log-likelihood for softmax-normalized scores while reweighting the contributions of
        positive and negative terms in the denominator.

        This loss function works great to train embeddings for retrieval setups where you have positive pairs
        (e.g., (query, relevant_doc)) as it will sample in each batch ``n-1`` negative docs randomly and incorporate a bias
        correction for improved robustness.

        The performance usually increases with increasing batch sizes.

        You can also provide one or multiple hard negatives per anchor-positive pair by structuring the data like this:
        ``(a_1, p_1, n_1), (a_2, p_2, n_2)``. Then, ``n_1`` is a hard negative for ``(a_1, p_1)``. The loss will use for
        the pair ``(a_i, p_i)`` all ``p_j`` for ``j != i``, all ``n_j`` as negatives, and apply the bias correction.

        Args:
            model: SentenceTransformer model
            scale: Output of similarity function is multiplied by scale
                value
            similarity_fct: similarity function between sentence
                embeddings. By default, cos_sim. Can also be set to dot
                product (and then set scale to 1)
            tau_plus: Prior probability.

        Requirements:
            1. The input batch should consist of (anchor, positive) pairs or (anchor, positive, negative) triplets.

        Inputs:

        Recommendations:
            - Use ``BatchSamplers.NO_DUPLICATES`` (:class:`docs <sentence_transformers.training_args.BatchSamplers>`) to
              ensure that no in-batch negatives are duplicates of the anchor or positive samples.

        Relations:
            - Extends :class:`MultipleNegativesRankingLoss` by incorporating a bias correction term.
