        BatchHardTripletLoss takes a batch with (sentence, label) pairs and computes the loss for all possible, valid
        triplets, i.e., anchor and positive must have the same label, anchor and negative a different label. It then looks
        for the hardest positive and the hardest negatives.
        The labels must be integers, with same label indicating sentences from the same class. Your train dataset
        must contain at least 2 examples per label class.

        Args:
            model: SentenceTransformer model
            distance_metric: Function that returns a distance between
                two embeddings. The class SiameseDistanceMetric contains
                pre-defined metrics that can be used
            margin: Negative samples should be at least margin further
                apart from the anchor than the positive.

        Definitions:
            :Easy triplets: Triplets which have a loss of 0 because
                ``distance(anchor, positive) + margin < distance(anchor, negative)``.
            :Hard triplets: Triplets where the negative is closer to the anchor than the positive, i.e.,
                ``distance(anchor, negative) < distance(anchor, positive)``.
            :Semi-hard triplets: Triplets where the negative is not closer to the anchor than the positive, but which
                still have a positive loss, i.e., ``distance(anchor, positive) < distance(anchor, negative) + margin``.

        Requirements:
            1. Each sentence must be labeled with a class.
            2. Your dataset must contain at least 2 examples per labels class.
            3. Your dataset should contain hard positives and negatives.

        Inputs:
            +------------------+--------+
            | Texts            | Labels |
            +==================+========+
            | single sentences | class  |
            +------------------+--------+

        Recommendations:
            - Use ``BatchSamplers.GROUP_BY_LABEL`` (:class:`docs <sentence_transformers.training_args.BatchSamplers>`) to
              ensure that each batch contains 2+ examples per label class.

        Relations:
            * :class:`BatchAllTripletLoss` uses all possible, valid triplets, rather than only the hardest positive and negative samples.
            * :class:`BatchSemiHardTripletLoss` uses only semi-hard triplets, valid triplets, rather than only the hardest positive and negative samples.
            * :class:`BatchHardSoftMarginTripletLoss` does not require setting a margin, while this loss does.
