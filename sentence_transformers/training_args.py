class BatchSamplers(ExplicitEnum):
    """
    Stores the acceptable string identifiers for batch samplers.

    The batch sampler is responsible for determining how samples are grouped into batches during training.
    Valid options are:

    - ``BatchSamplers.BATCH_SAMPLER``: **[default]** Uses :class:`~sentence_transformers.sampler.DefaultBatchSampler`, the default
      PyTorch batch sampler.
    - ``BatchSamplers.NO_DUPLICATES``: Uses :class:`~sentence_transformers.sampler.NoDuplicatesBatchSampler`,
      ensuring no duplicate samples in a batch. Recommended for losses that use in-batch negatives, such as:

        - :class:`~sentence_transformers.losses.MultipleNegativesRankingLoss`
        - :class:`~sentence_transformers.losses.CachedMultipleNegativesRankingLoss`
        - :class:`~sentence_transformers.losses.MultipleNegativesSymmetricRankingLoss`
        - :class:`~sentence_transformers.losses.CachedMultipleNegativesSymmetricRankingLoss`
        - :class:`~sentence_transformers.losses.MegaBatchMarginLoss`
        - :class:`~sentence_transformers.losses.GISTEmbedLoss`
        - :class:`~sentence_transformers.losses.CachedGISTEmbedLoss`
    - ``BatchSamplers.GROUP_BY_LABEL``: Uses :class:`~sentence_transformers.sampler.GroupByLabelBatchSampler`,
      ensuring that each batch has 2+ samples from the same label. Recommended for losses that require multiple
      samples from the same label, such as:

        - :class:`~sentence_transformers.losses.BatchAllTripletLoss`
        - :class:`~sentence_transformers.losses.BatchHardSoftMarginTripletLoss`
        - :class:`~sentence_transformers.losses.BatchHardTripletLoss`
        - :class:`~sentence_transformers.losses.BatchSemiHardTripletLoss`

    If you want to use a custom batch sampler, you can create a new Trainer class that inherits from
    :class:`~sentence_transformers.trainer.SentenceTransformerTrainer` and overrides the
    :meth:`~sentence_transformers.trainer.SentenceTransformerTrainer.get_batch_sampler` method. The
    method must return a class instance that supports ``__iter__`` and ``__len__`` methods. The former
    should yield a list of indices for each batch, and the latter should return the number of batches.

class MultiDatasetBatchSamplers(ExplicitEnum):
    """
    Stores the acceptable string identifiers for multi-dataset batch samplers.

    The multi-dataset batch sampler is responsible for determining in what order batches are sampled from multiple
    datasets during training. Valid options are:

    - ``MultiDatasetBatchSamplers.ROUND_ROBIN``: Uses :class:`~sentence_transformers.sampler.RoundRobinBatchSampler`,
      which uses round-robin sampling from each dataset until one is exhausted.
      With this strategy, it's likely that not all samples from each dataset are used, but each dataset is sampled
      from equally.
    - ``MultiDatasetBatchSamplers.PROPORTIONAL``: **[default]** Uses :class:`~sentence_transformers.sampler.ProportionalBatchSampler`,
      which samples from each dataset in proportion to its size.
      With this strategy, all samples from each dataset are used and larger datasets are sampled from more frequently.
