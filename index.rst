SentenceTransformers Documentation
=================================================

SentenceTransformers is a Python framework for state-of-the-art sentence, text and image embeddings. The initial work is described in our paper `Sentence-BERT: Sentence Embeddings using Siamese BERT-Networks <https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10084>`_.

You can use this framework to compute sentence / text embeddings for more than 100 languages. These embeddings can then be compared e.g. with cosine-similarity to find sentences with a similar meaning. This can be useful for `semantic textual similar <docs/usage/semantic_textual_similarity.html>`_, `semantic search <examples/applications/semantic-search/README.html>`_, or `paraphrase mining <examples/applications/paraphrase-mining/README.html>`_.

The framework is based on `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_ and `Transformers <https://huggingface.co/transformers/>`_ and offers a large collection of `pre-trained models <docs/pretrained_models.html>`_ tuned for various tasks. Further, it is easy to `fine-tune your own models <docs/training/overview.html>`_.


Installation
=================================================

You can install it using pip:

.. code-block:: python

   pip install -U sentence-transformers


We recommend **Python 3.6** or higher, and at least **PyTorch 1.6.0**. See `installation <docs/installation.html>`_ for further installation options, especially if you want to use a GPU.



Usage
=================================================
The usage is as simple as:

.. code-block:: python

    from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
    model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')

    #Our sentences we like to encode
    sentences = ['This framework generates embeddings for each input sentence',
        'Sentences are passed as a list of string.',
        'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.']

    #Sentences are encoded by calling model.encode()
    embeddings = model.encode(sentences)

    #Print the embeddings
    for sentence, embedding in zip(sentences, embeddings):
        print("Sentence:", sentence)
        print("Embedding:", embedding)
        print("")




Performance
=========================

Our models are evaluated extensively and achieve state-of-the-art performance on various tasks. Further, the code is tuned to provide the highest possible speed. Have a look at `Pre-Trained Models <https://www.sbert.net/docs/pretrained_models.html#sentence-embedding-models/>`_ for an overview of available models and the respective performance on different tasks.
