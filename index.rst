.. note::

   Sentence Transformers v4.0 just released, introducing a new training API for CrossEncoder (a.k.a. reranker) models. Read `Cross Encoder > Training Overview <docs/cross_encoder/training_overview.html>`_ to learn more about the training API, and check out `v4.0 Release Notes <https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers/releases/tag/v4.0.0>`_ for details on the other changes.

SentenceTransformers Documentation
==================================

Sentence Transformers (a.k.a. SBERT) is the go-to Python module for accessing, using, and training state-of-the-art embedding and reranker models.
It can be used to compute embeddings using Sentence Transformer models (`quickstart <docs/quickstart.html#sentence-transformer>`_) or to calculate similarity scores using Cross-Encoder (a.k.a. reranker) models (`quickstart <docs/quickstart.html#cross-encoder>`_). This unlocks a wide range of applications, including `semantic search <examples/sentence_transformer/applications/semantic-search/README.html>`_, `semantic textual similarity <docs/usage/semantic_textual_similarity.html>`_, and `paraphrase mining <examples/sentence_transformer/applications/paraphrase-mining/README.html>`_.

A wide selection of over `10,000 pre-trained Sentence Transformers models <https://huggingface.co/models?library=sentence-transformers>`_ are available for immediate use on ðŸ¤— Hugging Face, including many of the state-of-the-art models from the `Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB) leaderboard <https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard>`_. Additionally, it is easy to train or finetune your own `embedding models <docs/sentence_transformer/training_overview.html>`_ or `reranker models <docs/cross_encoder/training_overview.html>`_ using Sentence Transformers, enabling you to create custom models for your specific use cases.

Sentence Transformers was created by `UKPLab <http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/>`_ and is being maintained by `ðŸ¤— Hugging Face <https://huggingface.co>`_. Don't hesitate to open an issue on the `Sentence Transformers repository <https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers>`_ if something is broken or if you have further questions.

Usage
=====
.. seealso::
  
   See the `Quickstart <docs/quickstart.html>`_ for more quick information on how to use Sentence Transformers.

Working with Sentence Transformer models is straightforward:

.. sidebar:: Installation

   You can install *sentence-transformers* using pip:
   
   .. code-block:: python
   
      pip install -U sentence-transformers
   
   We recommend **Python 3.9+** and **PyTorch 1.11.0+**. See `installation <docs/installation.html>`_ for further installation options.

.. tab:: Embedding Models

   .. code-block:: python
   
      from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
   
      # 1. Load a pretrained Sentence Transformer model
      model = SentenceTransformer("all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
   
      # The sentences to encode
      sentences = [
          "The weather is lovely today.",
          "It's so sunny outside!",
          "He drove to the stadium.",
      ]
   
      # 2. Calculate embeddings by calling model.encode()
      embeddings = model.encode(sentences)
      print(embeddings.shape)
      # [3, 384]
   
      # 3. Calculate the embedding similarities
      similarities = model.similarity(embeddings, embeddings)
      print(similarities)
      # tensor([[1.0000, 0.6660, 0.1046],
      #         [0.6660, 1.0000, 0.1411],
      #         [0.1046, 0.1411, 1.0000]])

.. tab:: Reranker Models

   .. code-block:: python
   
      from sentence_transformers import CrossEncoder
      
      # 1. Load a pretrained CrossEncoder model
      model = CrossEncoder("cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L6-v2")
      
      # The texts for which to predict similarity scores
      query = "How many people live in Berlin?"
      passages = [
          "Berlin had a population of 3,520,031 registered inhabitants in an area of 891.82 square kilometers.",
          "Berlin has a yearly total of about 135 million day visitors, making it one of the most-visited cities in the European Union.",
          "In 2013 around 600,000 Berliners were registered in one of the more than 2,300 sport and fitness clubs.",
      ]
      
      # 2a. Either predict scores pairs of texts
      scores = model.predict([(query, passage) for passage in passages])
      print(scores)
      # => [8.607139 5.506266 6.352977]
      
      # 2b. Or rank a list of passages for a query
      ranks = model.rank(query, passages, return_documents=True)
      
      print("Query:", query)
      for rank in ranks:
          print(f"- #{rank['corpus_id']} ({rank['score']:.2f}): {rank['text']}")
      """
      Query: How many people live in Berlin?
      - #0 (8.61): Berlin had a population of 3,520,031 registered inhabitants in an area of 891.82 square kilometers.
      - #2 (6.35): In 2013 around 600,000 Berliners were registered in one of the more than 2,300 sport and fitness clubs.
