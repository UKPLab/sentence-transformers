   Sentence Transformers v4.1 just released, bringing the ONNX and OpenVINO backends to CrossEncoder (a.k.a. reranker) models. Read `Cross Encoder > Usage > Speeding up Inference <docs/cross_encoder/usage/efficiency.html>`_ to read more about the performance boosts that you can expect.

.. tip::

   Sentence Transformers v4.0 recently released, introducing a new training API for CrossEncoder (a.k.a. reranker) models. Read `Cross Encoder > Training Overview <docs/cross_encoder/training_overview.html>`_ to learn more about the training API, and check out `v4.0 Release Notes <https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers/releases/tag/v4.0.1>`_ for details on the other changes.

SentenceTransformers Documentation
==================================

Sentence Transformers (a.k.a. SBERT) is the go-to Python module for accessing, using, and training state-of-the-art embedding and reranker models.
It can be used to compute embeddings using Sentence Transformer models (`quickstart <docs/quickstart.html#sentence-transformer>`_), to calculate similarity scores using Cross-Encoder (a.k.a. reranker) models (`quickstart <docs/quickstart.html#cross-encoder>`_), or to generate sparse embeddings using Sparse Encoder models (`quickstart <docs/quickstart.html#sparse-encoder>`_). This unlocks a wide range of applications, including `semantic search <examples/sentence_transformer/applications/semantic-search/README.html>`_, `semantic textual similarity <docs/usage/semantic_textual_similarity.html>`_, and `paraphrase mining <examples/sentence_transformer/applications/paraphrase-mining/README.html>`_.

A wide selection of over `10,000 pre-trained Sentence Transformers models <https://huggingface.co/models?library=sentence-transformers>`_ are available for immediate use on 🤗 Hugging Face, including many of the state-of-the-art models from the `Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB) leaderboard <https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard>`_. Additionally, it is easy to train or finetune your own `embedding models <docs/sentence_transformer/training_overview.html>`_, `reranker models <docs/cross_encoder/training_overview.html>`_, or `sparse encoder models <docs/sparse_encoder/training_overview.html>`_ using Sentence Transformers, enabling you to create custom models for your specific use cases.

Sentence Transformers was created by `UKPLab <http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/>`_ and is being maintained by `🤗 Hugging Face <https://huggingface.co>`_. Don't hesitate to open an issue on the `Sentence Transformers repository <https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers>`_ if something is broken or if you have further questions.
