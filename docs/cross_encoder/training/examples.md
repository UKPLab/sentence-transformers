# Training Examples

See the following examples how to train Cross-Encoders:

- [training_stsbenchmark.py](../../../examples/training/cross-encoder/training_stsbenchmark.py) - Example how to train for Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) on the STS benchmark dataset.
- [training_quora_duplicate_questions.py](../../../examples/training/cross-encoder/training_quora_duplicate_questions.py) - Example how to train a Cross-Encoder to predict if two questions are duplicates. Uses Quora Duplicate Questions as training dataset.
- [training_nli.py](../../../examples/training/cross-encoder/training_nli.py) - Example for a multilabel classification task for Natural Language Inference (NLI) task.
