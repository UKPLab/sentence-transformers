Characteristics of Cross Encoder (a.k.a reranker) models:

1. Calculates a **similarity score** given **pairs of texts**.
2. Generally provides **superior performance** compared to a Sentence Transformer (a.k.a. bi-encoder) model.
3. Often **slower** than a Sentence Transformer model, as it requires computation for each pair rather than each text.
4. Due to the previous 2 characteristics, Cross Encoders are often used to **re-rank the top-k results** from a Sentence Transformer model.

Once you have `installed <../../installation.html>`_ Sentence Transformers, you can easily use Cross Encoder models:

.. sidebar:: Documentation

   1. :class:`~sentence_transformers.cross_encoder.CrossEncoder`
   2. :meth:`CrossEncoder.predict <sentence_transformers.cross_encoder.CrossEncoder.predict>`
   3. :meth:`CrossEncoder.rank <sentence_transformers.cross_encoder.CrossEncoder.rank>`

   .. note::
      MS Marco models return logits rather than scores between 0 and 1. Load the :class:`~sentence_transformers.cross_encoder.CrossEncoder` with ``default_activation_function=torch.nn.Sigmoid()`` to get scores between 0 and 1. This does not affect the ranking.
