# TED 2020 - Parallel Sentences Corpus

This dataset contains a crawl of nearly 4000 TED (https://www.ted.com/) and TED-X transcripts from July 2020. The transcripts have been translated by a global community of volunteers (https://www.ted.com/participate/translate) to more than 100 languages.

The transcripts for the different languages have been sentence aligned to generate a parallel corpus that can be used to train machine translation systems.

Tab-Seperated file containing all aligned sentences:
[https://public.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/reimers/sentence-transformers/datasets/ted2020.tsv.gz](https://public.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/reimers/sentence-transformers/datasets/ted2020.tsv.gz)

The ted2020.tsv.gz is a tab-seperated file containing all aligned sentences. The first line specifies the language code. Additionally, the first column is 'talkid' with the information from which talk the sentence stems.

## Usage

You can easily load the dataset using Pandas:
```python
import pandas
import csv

df = pandas.read_csv(
    "ted2020.tsv.gz",
    sep="\t",
    keep_default_na=False,
    encoding="utf8",
    quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONE,
)
```



Or with Python CSV reader:
```python
import csv
import gzip

with gzip.open("ted2020.tsv.gz", "rt", encoding="utf8") as fIn:
    reader = csv.DictReader(fIn, delimiter="\t", quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONE)
    for line in reader:
        print(line)
```

## Notes
Note, not every sentence is translated to the 100 languages. Some talks have been translated only to few languages (see https://www.ted.com/participate/translate/our-languages). If a sentence has no translation, the cell in that file is empty.

Further note that the translators did not translate sentence-by-sentence. This can cause that an English sentences was translated to multiple sentence in the target language. Also, it can be that multiple English sentences where translated to a single sentence in the target language. By using the timings in the transcript, we tried to align the sentences as good as possible. This causes that a column can contain more than one sentence.
