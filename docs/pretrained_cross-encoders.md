# Pretrained Cross-Encoders

This page lists available **pretrained Cross-Encoders**. Cross-Encoders require the input of a text pair and output a score 0...1. They do not work for individual sentences and they don't compute embeddings for individual texts.

## MS MARCO
[MS MARCO Passage Retrieval](https://github.com/microsoft/MSMARCO-Passage-Ranking) is a large dataset with real user queries from Bing search engine with annotated relevant text passages.

These models can be used like this:
```python
from sentence_transformers import CrossEncoder
model = CrossEncoder('model_name', max_length=512)
scores = model.predict([('Query1', 'Paragraph1'), ('Query1', 'Paragraph2')])

#For Example
scores = model.predict([('How many people live in Berlin?', 'Berlin had a population of 3,520,031 registered inhabitants in an area of 891.82 square kilometers.'), 
                        ('How many people live in Berlin?', 'Berlin is well known for its museums.')])
```

## SQuAD (QNLI)

QNLI is based on the [SQuAD dataset](https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/) and was introduced by the [GLUE Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07461). Given a passage from Wikipedia, annotators created questions that are answerable by that passage.

- **cross-encoder/qnli-distilroberta-base** - Accuracy on QNLI dev set: 90.96
- **cross-encoder/qnli-electra-base** - Accuracy on QNLI dev set: 93.21


## STSbenchmark
The following models can be used like this:
```python
from sentence_transformers import CrossEncoder
model = CrossEncoder('model_name')
scores = model.predict([('Sent A1', 'Sent B1'), ('Sent A2', 'Sent B2')])
```

They return a score  0...1 indicating the semantic similarity of the given sentence pair.
- **cross-encoder/stsb-TinyBERT-L-4** - STSbenchmark test performance: 85.50
- **cross-encoder/stsb-distilroberta-base** - STSbenchmark test performance: 87.92
- **cross-encoder/stsb-roberta-base** - STSbenchmark test performance: 90.17
- **cross-encoder/stsb-roberta-large** - STSbenchmark test performance: 91.47 

## Quora Duplicate Questions
These models have been trained on the [Quora duplicate questions dataset](https://www.quora.com/q/quoradata/First-Quora-Dataset-Release-Question-Pairs). They can used like the STSb models and give a score 0...1 indicating the probability that two questions are duplicate questions.

- **cross-encoder/quora-distilroberta-base** - Average Precision dev set: 87.48
- **cross-encoder/quora-roberta-base** - Average Precision dev set: 87.80
- **cross-encoder/quora-roberta-large** - Average Precision dev set: 87.91

Note: The model don't work for question similarity. The question *How to learn Java* and *How to learn Python* will get a low score, as these questions are not duplicates. For question similarity, the respective bi-encoder trained on the Quora dataset yields much more meaningful results.



## NLI
Given two sentences, are these contradicting each other, entailing one the other or are these netural? The following models were trained on the [SNLI](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/) and [MultiNLI](https://cims.nyu.edu/~sbowman/multinli/) datasets.
- **cross-encoder/nli-deberta-v3-base** - Accuracy on MNLI mismatched set: 90.04
- **cross-encoder/nli-deberta-base** - Accuracy on MNLI mismatched set: 88.08
- **cross-encoder/nli-deberta-v3-xsmall** - Accuracy on MNLI mismatched set:  87.77
- **cross-encoder/nli-deberta-v3-small** - Accuracy on MNLI mismatched set: 87.55
- **cross-encoder/nli-roberta-base** - Accuracy on MNLI mismatched set: 87.47
- **cross-encoder/nli-MiniLM2-L6-H768** - Accuracy on MNLI mismatched set: 86.89  
- **cross-encoder/nli-distilroberta-base** - Accuracy on MNLI mismatched set: 83.98

```python
from sentence_transformers import CrossEncoder
model = CrossEncoder('model_name')
scores = model.predict([('A man is eating pizza', 'A man eats something'), ('A black race car starts up in front of a crowd of people.', 'A man is driving down a lonely road.')])

#Convert scores to labels
label_mapping = ['contradiction', 'entailment', 'neutral']
labels = [label_mapping[score_max] for score_max in scores.argmax(axis=1)]
```
