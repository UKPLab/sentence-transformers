# Dataset Overview

```eval_rst
.. hint::

   **Quickstart:** Find `curated datasets <https://huggingface.co/collections/sentence-transformers/embedding-model-datasets-6644d7a3673a511914aa7552>`_ or `community datasets <https://huggingface.co/datasets?other=sentence-transformers>`_, choose a loss function via this `loss overview <loss_overview.html>`_, and `verify <training_overview.html#dataset-format>`_ that it works with your dataset.
```

It is important that your dataset format matches your loss function (or that you choose a loss function that matches your dataset format). See [Training Overview > Dataset Format](./training_overview.html#dataset-format) to learn how to verify whether a dataset format works with a loss function.

In practice, most dataset configurations will take one of four forms:

- **Positive Pair**: A pair of related sentences. This can be used both for symmetric tasks (semantic textual similarity) or asymmetric tasks (semantic search), with examples including pairs of paraphrases, pairs of full texts and their summaries, pairs of duplicate questions, pairs of (`query`, `response`), or pairs of (`source_language`, `target_language`). Natural Language Inference datasets can also be formatted this way by pairing entailing sentences.
   - **Examples:** [sentence-transformers/sentence-compression](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sentence-transformers/sentence-compression), [sentence-transformers/coco-captions](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sentence-transformers/coco-captions), [sentence-transformers/codesearchnet](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sentence-transformers/codesearchnet), [sentence-transformers/natural-questions](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sentence-transformers/natural-questions), [sentence-transformers/gooaq](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sentence-transformers/gooaq), [sentence-transformers/squad](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sentence-transformers/squad), [sentence-transformers/wikihow](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sentence-transformers/wikihow), [sentence-transformers/eli5](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sentence-transformers/eli5)
- **Triplets**: (anchor, positive, negative) text triplets. These datasets don't need labels.
   - **Examples:** [sentence-transformers/quora-duplicates](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sentence-transformers/quora-duplicates), [nirantk/triplets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nirantk/triplets), [sentence-transformers/all-nli](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sentence-transformers/all-nli)
- **Pair with Similarity Score**: A pair of sentences with a score indicating their similarity. Common examples are "Semantic Textual Similarity" datasets.
   - **Examples:** [sentence-transformers/stsb](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sentence-transformers/stsb), [PhilipMay/stsb_multi_mt](https://huggingface.co/datasets/PhilipMay/stsb_multi_mt).
- **Texts with Classes**: A text with its corresponding class. This data format is easily converted by loss functions into three sentences (triplets) where the first is an "anchor", the second a "positive" of the same class as the anchor, and the third a "negative" of a different class.
   - **Examples:** [trec](https://huggingface.co/datasets/trec), [yahoo_answers_topics](https://huggingface.co/datasets/yahoo_answers_topics).

Note that it is often simple to transform a dataset from one format to another, such that it works with your loss function of choice.

```eval_rst

.. tip::

   You can use :func:`~sentence_transformers.util.mine_hard_negatives` to convert a dataset of positive pairs into a dataset of triplets. It uses a :class:`~sentence_transformers.SentenceTransformer` model to find hard negatives: texts that are similar to the first dataset column, but are not quite as similar as the text in the second dataset column. Datasets with hard triplets often outperform datasets with just positive pairs.
   
   For example, we mined hard negatives from `sentence-transformers/gooaq <https://huggingface.co/datasets/sentence-transformers/gooaq>`_ to produce `tomaarsen/gooaq-hard-negatives <https://huggingface.co/datasets/tomaarsen/gooaq-hard-negatives>`_ and trained `tomaarsen/mpnet-base-gooaq <https://huggingface.co/tomaarsen/mpnet-base-gooaq>`_ and `tomaarsen/mpnet-base-gooaq-hard-negatives <https://huggingface.co/tomaarsen/mpnet-base-gooaq-hard-negatives>`_ on the two datasets, respectively. Sadly, the two models use a different evaluation split, so their performance can't be compared directly.

## Datasets on the Hugging Face Hub

```eval_rst
The `Datasets library <https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/index>`_ (``pip install datasets``) allows you to load datasets from the Hugging Face Hub with the :func:`~datasets.load_dataset` function::

   from datasets import load_dataset

   # Indicate the dataset id from the Hub
   dataset_id = "sentence-transformers/natural-questions"
   dataset = load_dataset(dataset_id, split="train")
   """
   Dataset({
      features: ['query', 'answer'],
      num_rows: 100231
   })
   """
   print(dataset[0])
   """
   {
      'query': 'when did richmond last play in a preliminary final',
      'answer': "Richmond Football Club Richmond began 2017 with 5 straight wins, a feat it had not achieved since 1995. A series of close losses hampered the Tigers throughout the middle of the season, including a 5-point loss to the Western Bulldogs, 2-point loss to Fremantle, and a 3-point loss to the Giants. Richmond ended the season strongly with convincing victories over Fremantle and St Kilda in the final two rounds, elevating the club to 3rd on the ladder. Richmond's first final of the season against the Cats at the MCG attracted a record qualifying final crowd of 95,028; the Tigers won by 51 points. Having advanced to the first preliminary finals for the first time since 2001, Richmond defeated Greater Western Sydney by 36 points in front of a crowd of 94,258 to progress to the Grand Final against Adelaide, their first Grand Final appearance since 1982. The attendance was 100,021, the largest crowd to a grand final since 1986. The Crows led at quarter time and led by as many as 13, but the Tigers took over the game as it progressed and scored seven straight goals at one point. They eventually would win by 48 points – 16.12 (108) to Adelaide's 8.12 (60) – to end their 37-year flag drought.[22] Dustin Martin also became the first player to win a Premiership medal, the Brownlow Medal and the Norm Smith Medal in the same season, while Damien Hardwick was named AFL Coaches Association Coach of the Year. Richmond's jump from 13th to premiers also marked the biggest jump from one AFL season to the next."

For more information on how to manipulate your dataset see the [Datasets Documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/access).

```eval_rst
.. tip::
   
   It's common for Hugging Face Datasets to contain extraneous columns, e.g. sample_id, metadata, source, type, etc. You can use :meth:`Dataset.remove_columns <datasets.Dataset.remove_columns>` to remove these columns, as they will be used as inputs otherwise. You can also use :meth:`Dataset.select_columns <datasets.Dataset.select_columns>` to keep only the desired columns.
```

## Pre-existing Datasets

The [Hugging Face Hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets) hosts 150k+ datasets, many of which can be converted for training embedding models. 
We are aiming to tag all Hugging Face datasets that work out of the box with Sentence Transformers with `sentence-transformers`, allowing you to easily find them by browsing to [https://huggingface.co/datasets?other=sentence-transformers](https://huggingface.co/datasets?other=sentence-transformers). We strongly recommend that you browse these datasets to find training datasets that might be useful for your tasks.

These are some of the popular pre-existing datasets tagged as ``sentence-transformers`` that can be used to train and fine-tune SentenceTransformer models:
